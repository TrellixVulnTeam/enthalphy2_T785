This file, README.Dalton2011, contains some general information about
how to create the Dalton2011 scripts and executables, and how to test them.

The distribution is a source distribution, no executables are provided.
That is, you must run the appropriate scripts and commands yourself
to create scripts and executables for production calculations.
The default location of these will be in the ./bin subdirectory
(which is empty when you have a fresh copy of the Dalton2011 distributioon).

If you have a site licence, one way to fulfill your obligations to make the
source codes unavailable to the general user is to make the DALTON and
LSDALTON directories unreadable by the general user. You are welcome to
tell the general user that she/he can get access to the source code by
getting a personal licence.

===============================================================================
To make the scripts and executables:

* DALTON:
      cd DALTON
      ./configure
      # check compilers and compiler options in ./Makefile.config
      # created by configure
      make >& make.log &
      # when you have the executable(s) we recommend that you test them:
      cd test/
      TEST -keep -benchmark all > TEST_all.log 2>&1 &
      # if you have created an mpi version of DALTON:
      #    edit and adapt ./parTEST.sh to your local system
      #    submit parTEST.sh
      #
      # Check if the tests are passed
      cd ../../

* LSDALTON:
      cd LSDALTON
      ./configure
      # check compilers and compiler options in ./Makefile.config
      # created by configure
      # NB! this version of LSDALTON can only be parallelized with
      # openMP, not with MPI.
      make >& make.log &
      # when you have the executable we recommend that you test it:
      cd test/
      TEST -keep -benchmark all > TEST_all.log 2>&1 &
      # Check if the tests are passed
      cd ../../
